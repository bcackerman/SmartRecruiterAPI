## SmartRecruiter JQuery API

All references to SmartRecruiter belong to them.

This is a JQuery plugin you can use to access 

Getting started locally:

1. To launch this locally use and run using MAMP/WAML (any local web server)
2. Launch Chrome with so you can use the API correctly```/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security &```  This has to do with me pull XML results from a different domain, Google Chrome doesn't like that by default.
3. Set your specific variables in ```core.js```

```index.html``` will show your results for an example.
